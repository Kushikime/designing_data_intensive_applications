# designing_data_intensive_applications

Purpose:
A repo for that maybe will help me stay consistent with the book and also help me learn MD syntax for documentation. Since I anyway using it in Obsidian I thought maybe it can be a useful thing in the futute.

Alongside reading the book I plan to keep .md files in different sections maybe I would go with Chapter based docs. We'll see.

I see each document as a separate topic.

For each topic I would see sense to start just document things out of my head.

at the bottom have some section with terms I meet first time or I find to need explanation.

After finishing a chapter go through the code and fix grammar issues/mistakes.
